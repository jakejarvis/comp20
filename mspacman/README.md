# Lab 4: Ms. Pac-Man

1. I believe I have correctly implemented all aspects of this lab. I used Photoshop to discover the exact dimensions of the board and the appropriate Ms. Pac-Man sprite, and their exact coordinates in the sprite image. I kept their original size instead of stretching them to fit the 800 x 600 canvas.

2. I collaborated with nobody.

3. I spent approximately one hour on this lab.
