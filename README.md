# Jake Jarvis' COMP 20 Repository

Q1. What is this purpose of this Git repository?

> This repository contains the code behind all of the assignments I have written for [COMP 20](http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/) at [Tufts University](http://www.cs.tufts.edu) ([@tuftsdev](https://github.com/tuftsdev)).

Q2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

> My favorite assignment was [Assigntment 3](http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html), aka the Marauder's Map server. I learned web programming when I was very young with HTML and PHP – in fact, for some unknown reason, PHP was the first ever programming language I learned. My HTML knowledge has served me quite well from then until now, with only a few tweaks for HTML 5. I'm sure my PHP skills would still be perfectly appropriate too if I were to start coding in it but, unfortunately, my maiden language is not as loved as it once was. So learning Node.js, the freshest web language out there today, is an investment that I am sure will serve me as well as PHP did for 10+ years. It was shocking to be part of a college course that is so incredibly up-to-date.

Q3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

> I have learned how to ask effective and specific questions (both to Ming and to Google). Even though it is easier than ever to ask questions and get quick responses via Piazza, I forced myself to work through some problems by setting a 60-minute timer during which I did not allow myself to post a question. In the vast majority of cases, I figured it out myself and learned WAY more than I would have by just asking for a lifeline.
>
> If I were to post to Piazza, I would make sure the question focused on *exactly* the problem I was stuck on with very specific lines of code only if necessary, instead of describing generally what's "not right" and telling Ming to sift through my entire repository.
>
> Likewise, in class, I tried to put myself in the shoes of everybody else and ask questions that were not in-depth, but were around overarching concepts that I could forsee myself wondering about in the near future. Even though Google can explain a lot of things, Ming can probably explain them more succinctly and friendly. :)

Q4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

> Don't reinvent the wheel. And, on a related note, always break down bigger problems into smaller ones – once you've broken down a problem into enough parts, there are most likely pieces of it that you don't have to (and shouldn't) reinvent!
> 
> The most blatant example I can think of is the example Ming showed us on the day he introduced Node.js and Express. Without telling us that there was soon to be an easier way to do this, he showed us a long-winded method to setting up a simple web server that showed a static homepage. A lot of it seemed really obvious and redundant...because it was. I let out a big sigh of relief when he showed us someone had already done the "hard" work for us in the form of Express. While we were fully capable of doing it the long way, not taking advantage of other developers' sweat and tears is just wasting our most valuable resource – time. This lesson really stuck with me.
> 
> Secondly, the discovery of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) was eye-opening. Unless you are (or have on payroll) a designer who is looking for something very, very specific, there's no reason to drive yourself crazy making the ugly default text-box a little less ugly, when you could be putting that time into rounding the edges on the backend in terms of security or new features.

Q5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

> I would like to delve deeper into user interfaces. It's one thing to know how to place a button onto the screen, but it's a whole other thing to know (or predict) where your millions of users will instinctively expect that button to be based on classical conditioning.

Thank you so much Ming!! This has been far-and-away my favorite course during my time here at Tufts and I will recommend it highly (not that you need even higher enrollment numbers to deal with). If it's okay I would love to keep in touch about both the rest of my time here at Tufts as well as other nerdy stuff. Have a fantastic summer.
