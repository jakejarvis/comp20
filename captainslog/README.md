# Lab 7: Captain's Log

1. All aspects of the lab have been implemented correctly. However, if I understand this correctly, the page may show the messages stored by everyone else's Captain's Log since we are all on tuftsdev.github.io.

2. I have not worked with anybody.

3. I spent approximately 1 hour on this assignment. (Again, very sorry this is late â€“ please feel free to deduct a token!)
