# Assignment 2: The Real Marauder's Map

1. I believe I have implemented all aspects of the assignment correctly. The page pinpoints the user, represented by an adorable panda, and sends the user's location to the server. The page then pinpoints every user returned by the server, calculates their distance, and displays their login and distance from the user in an info window activated upon click. The script catches the major possible errors and outputs nothing in the console.

2. Collaborated with nobody.

3. Spent approximately 6 hours total.
